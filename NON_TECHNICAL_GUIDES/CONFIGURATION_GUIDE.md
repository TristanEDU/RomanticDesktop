## Troubleshooting Configuration Issues

### "Config validation failed" error during install

1. Open config.txt in Notepad
2. Check:
   - ✅ `HER_NAME=` has a value (not blank)
   - ✅ `ANNIVERSARY_DATE=` is in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - ✅ `ANNIVERSARY_DATE=` is not in the future
   - ✅ `WELCOME_TIMEOUT=` is a number between 5-300
   - ✅ At least one `MESSAGE=` line exists in [MESSAGES] section
   - ✅ Each message is 200 characters or less
3. Save and try installing again

### Welcome message shows "My Love" instead of her name

- Config.txt is not being read correctly
- Check file encoding (should be UTF-8 with BOM)
- Re-create config.txt with proper encoding

### Changes don't take effect after logging in

1. Log out completely (not just lock screen)
2. Log back in
3. Check if welcome message appears with new content

### Emoji characters don't display in welcome message

- File encoding is probably wrong
- Should be UTF-8 with BOM (Notepad should handle this automatically)
- Try re-saving the file in Notepad

---

## Advanced Options

### Using Variable Substitution

**Available variables:**

- `{NAME}` — Replaced with HER_NAME value

**Example:**

```
MESSAGE=Good morning, {NAME}! I love you! ❤️
```

Displays as:

```
Good morning, Sarah! I love you! ❤️
```

### Character Limit Tips

**Each message can be 200 characters max.** Here's how to check:

```
MESSAGE=Good morning, beautiful! Hope your day is as amazing as you are ❤️
```

Count that = about 85 characters. Plenty of room!

Longer examples (still under 200):

```
MESSAGE=Every single day with you is a gift. You make me smile, you inspire me, and you make me want to be a better person. Have an amazing day, beautiful! 💕
```

That's about 165 characters. Still good!

## After Editing config.txt

1. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S in Notepad)
2. **Close Notepad**
3. **Log out** from Windows
4. **Log back in**
5. **See your updated welcome message!** 💕

That's it! No need to reinstall or restart anything.
