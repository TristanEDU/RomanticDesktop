## Method 1: Safe Uninstall with Preview (Recommended)

This method shows you exactly what will be deleted **before** anything is removed.

### Step 1: Open PowerShell

1. Search "PowerShell" in Start menu
2. Right-click ? **Run as Administrator**
3. Click **Yes** when prompted

### Step 2: Run Uninstaller with Preview

In PowerShell, run:

```powershell
C:\RomanticCustomization\UNINSTALL.ps1 -WhatIf
```

This shows **[DRY RUN MODE]** with:

- What would be deleted
- What would be removed from registry
- What would be reverted

**Review the output carefully.**

### Step 3: Run Actual Uninstall

If everything looks correct, run **without** the `-WhatIf`:

```powershell
C:\RomanticCustomization\UNINSTALL.ps1
```

You'll be asked: **"Continue with uninstall? (Y/N)"**

Type `Y` and press Enter.

### Step 4: Confirm Removal

You'll see:

```
[1/5] Removing scheduled task...
[2/5] Removing C:\RomanticCustomization...
[3/5] Removing registry entries...
[4/5] Restoring Windows theme...
[5/5] Finalizing...

Uninstall Complete!
